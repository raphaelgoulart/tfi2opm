# tfi2opm

It converts one or more .tfi files to a single .opm file, up to a maximum of 128 .tfi files.

It requires [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) or higher to run.

### Usage

Drag and drop one or multiple .tfi files into the executable file, and the program will write an 'output.opm' file.

You can drag up to 128 .tfi files, since that's the maximum amount of patches VOPM supports.
